This repository contains my Deep Learning projects and lab implementations completed as part of my coursework. It covers fundamental concepts and practical applications of deep learning using Python, TensorFlow, and Keras.

The projects demonstrate:

Implementation of neural networks for classification and regression

Use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image-related tasks

Training, validation, and testing workflows

Evaluation using accuracy, loss, and other performance metrics

Hands-on experiments with optimization, regularization, and activation functions

The goal of this repository is to provide a structured collection of experiments and models that highlight the core ideas of Deep Learning and how they can be applied to solve real-world problems.
